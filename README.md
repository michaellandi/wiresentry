## About ##

Wire Sentry is a tool for analyzing network patterns to identify malicious activity.  It actively captures network traffic and compares the traffic against various scanners which attempt to identify these activities.  Wire Sentry is built upon a modular architecture in which attack patterns and scanners can be added to the application via dynamically loaded modules.  It is distributed with an SDK for creating these add-on modules in the hope that a large library of attack patterns can be created.

The application is currently coded in c# using the [mono][mono] framework.  Future portions of this application will use C and Ruby on Rails to add new features.
